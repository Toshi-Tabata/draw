# Small Drawing App for Web Browsers
- Small browser application I made after getting an apple pencil and finding out that browsers have support for it.
- Trying to apply what I've learned from Programming Fundamentals COMP1511

## Features
- Undo/redo using a stack (just learned about these)
- Smooth(er) lines drawn by using `quadraticCurveTo` instead of making straight lines between points
- Apple Pencil Support
- Changing canvas size without losing the drawn image or creating desync between cursor and line
  - This was probably the hardest thing to figure out

## TODO
- Drawing a dot on the screen without dragging the mouse/pen (I've noticed not many apps have this actually)
